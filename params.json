{"name":"rnutjs","tagline":"rPeANUt assembler, emulator and web-based IDE","body":"rnutjs is a web-based IDE, assembler and emulator for the Australian National University (ANU)'s architecture rPeANUt.\r\n\r\nThere is a live version at [***REMOVED***.com/app/rnutjs](http://***REMOVED***.com/app/rnutjs).\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project was to create an IDE that would facilitate working across different devices. The original rPeANUt simulator is written in Java, which isn't supported by current iOS devices. Although this web implementation falls short in terms of speed (it will run at about 2/3rd the speed), it can be run on any modern browser (not tested in IE or Opera; has known bugs running in Firefox).\r\n\r\nIt makes use of HTML5 local storage and the Dropbox API to store and synchronize files across sessions and devices.\r\n\r\nThe IDE is mobile-web-app capable, allowing it to be run on mobile devices without the of UI the browser.\r\n\r\nFeatures coming in future updates:\r\n  1. Macros\r\n  2. Screndump\r\n  3. Strings in blocks\r\n\r\nIn the long run, the plan is to replace the rPeANUt emulator with a hardware simulator.\r\n\r\nPreview\r\n=======\r\n\r\nImage 1: Preview of running program.\r\n![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/***REMOVED***/rnutjs/master/preview0.png)\r\n\r\nImage 2: Preview of file storage.\r\n![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/***REMOVED***/rnutjs/master/preview1.png)","google":"UA-47471263-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
